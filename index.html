    <h2>What We Do & Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>
        At CactusEdge Security, we provide penetration testing, also known as ethical hacking, to help small businesses proactively identify and fix vulnerabilities before attackers find them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cybercriminals don’t just target big companies. Small businesses are often at greater risk because they may have limited security protections. That’s why vulnerability management is critical. It helps prevent data breaches, website defacement, and stolen customer information.
    </p>
    <p>
        We simulate real-world cyberattacks to uncover weak points in your website and digital assets. Our team provides clear, actionable recommendations tailored to your business, not a generic report.
    </p>
    <p>
        Pricing varies depending on your site’s size and complexity, but we always keep small business budgets in mind. If you're interested, please fill out the contact form below, and we’ll personally review your site and reach out to you.
