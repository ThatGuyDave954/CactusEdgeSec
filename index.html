        <h2>Why Vulnerability Management Matters</h2>
        <p>
            For small businesses, vulnerability management is critical. Cyberattacks often target businesses like yours, not just large corporations. Small vulnerabilities can lead to serious risks like data breaches, website defacement, or stolen customer information.
        </p>
        <p>
            That’s where we come in. We help you find and fix weaknesses before they become real problems, giving you peace of mind so you can focus on growing your business.

        <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <p>
            Penetration testing simulates real-world cyberattacks to identify vulnerabilities in your website and digital assets. It’s a proactive health check for your online presence that uncovers weak points before someone else does.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every business is unique, and pricing depends on many factors. We’ll review your site personally and recommend what’s best for you.
